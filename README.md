# gridLock

gridLock is intended to be a open-source project that is accepting contributions from developers of all skill levels, and developers will be rewarded with ownership. It was built off of the Moralis dexStarter template on IAmJaysWay github page. If Jay or Moralis view this before me contacting you, I plan on awarding you based on the ownership of the intellectual property. 

# Who we are?

gridLock is intended to be an organization made up of collective of developers who see the same vision of a decentralized world, not owned or controlled by any individual or small group of people who have to much control. This will be a DAO that will be made up of the people, by the people, and for the people. For that purpose, I plan on giving away as much as 50-70% ownership to individuals and organization that provide support to gridLocks objectives. The rest will be used to raise capital for implementation of Phase 3 or a crypto commodity futures contracts that will be settled in the real world.

We will be the new foundation for the free market economy. Our inital objective is to bridge the gap between investors and crypto companies. Or get capital to crypto companies who intend to increase the utility of crypto currency's. Further details will be outlined below in Phase 1. For that purpose, gridLock won't have a CEO, but a representative to speak for the developers who built the app. We will enable DAO voting on our application, and major decisions will be made through the collective of ownership holders. This will take major responsiblity off the representative of the company, and put it on the collective of owners. 

Starting this organization has been about the longevity and sustainablitity of the future of mankind. It is no secret the economic conditions have become more difficult, but also have disincentivized hardwork and innovation. Building this application will bring the incentive back to individuals to work hard, and innovate with in the crypto ecosystem. Additionally, it will be a stance against oppressive regimes that will put the power back in the hands of the people. All of these things will set the stage for how DAO's will be intended to start, and continue to operate. 

The more decentralized we are the stronger we will be, so fill free to fix even the smallest errors or bugs. Much of it I will outline and reference in the walk through video, but even so much as fixing mobile view could yield .1% of tokens issued. Our token has not launched, and I do not plan on launching it until May or so. If you wish to contribute below is outlined the next steps we need to complete the project, up to a standard that is open for discussion, if you have creative ideas or implementations feel free to share them.

# Phase 1(No developer will recieve more than 5%. Any additional work will just increase the value of the company or your ownership)

Phase 1 is to prepare a form of crypto stock market, or fungible tokens. Business operations will be filing for a C-corp with the SEC, and recieving eligiblity to list securities that are fungible tokens. Thus far, 9 tokens have filed with the SEC, and our first step will be to set up a portal for crypto owners to file there token as a form of ownership with the stock. There are strength in numbers so the more companies we send them, the less likely they will be to reject us any longer. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
Much of the ownership distribution will be to independent changes made to improve the application. If you see a bug and fix it, then you will be rewarded. Have an idea to improve the project, you will be rewarded. We hope to complete Phase 1 by May 1 2024, let BUIDL!!!


# Phase 1 Development needs

1. get the creators address and display all transactions from contract address. 
    .25% or more
2. Create a vault contract that stores company details, and are updatable by creator address. (Template available in DEFIProtocol/Vault)
    .5% or more
3. Retrieve all transcations from wallet address and import them into a table in the app. 
    .25% or more
4. Create income statement off of available transactions above. Additional tables if applicable cash flows, balance sheet will yield more ownership. (Track incoming and outgoing transactions) 
    .5% or more.
5. Enable DAO voting based on token ownership at a given block. ie. 10% ownership gets 10% of voting power.(Template available at DEFIProtocol/Blockchain-Vote).
    .5% or more
6. Change chart to a more desirable landscape.
    .25% or more
7. Get more reliable data source than coin ranking. Coin ranking has inaccurate market data, and pricing for some coins. Looking at Coin Market Cap preferably or Binance as a last option.
    .5% or more
8. Enable limit orders using 1Inch limit order protocol(Most Decentralized)(docs available at https://docs.1inch.io/docs/limit-order-protocol/introduction)
    2% or more
9. Set up Homescreen with wallet holding, and preferably a chart.
    .5% or more
10. Set up back-end using MongoDb as a starting point for the company. Add users to a table with watchlist that either attaches uuid or contract address.(Added at the end of token card and top of token details page removable from home page)
    .5% or more

# Phase 2

Phase 2 will create a derivative of the Forex market and enable purchase of Bitcoin and Ethereum in fiat. A custodial wallet will need to be put in place, but would also like to offer a cold storage options where users control there own private keys.  Creating trading pairs between USDC(USD), USDT(USD), XCHF(Franc), EURS(EUR), EURT(EUR), AG(EUR) and any other trading pair available. More details will be avaiable toward the end of Phase 1.

1. Add trading pair header with trading pairs listed in Cards.(Similar to Tokens page)

    .25% or more
2. Implement charts and buying and selling function for trading pairs.
    .5% or more
3. Custodial wallet creation.

# Phase 3

In phase 3 we would like to implement commodity futures contracts settled in real-time. We would need a DoorDash style algorithm to allow semi-truck drivers to pick-up and complete deliveries in a contractual way. With a very complex smart contract. There will need to be AI implemented to get such done as well as an approval function to allow producers, processors, and farmers to become approved and create tokens. Tokens would be burned upon delivery. May even need cargo ship approvals for international transportation. More details will be provided toward the end of phase 1, and even more closer to end of phase 2.
